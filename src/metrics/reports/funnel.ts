/**
 * The install funnel (spec 4.12).
 *
 * Five ordered steps, of which the first two are Google's and the last three are
 * Shopify's:
 *
 *   1 listing page view   GA4 export      a browser opened the App Store listing
 *   2 add-app click       GA4 export      that browser clicked Install
 *   3 installed           Partner API     a merchant chose the app, first time
 *                                         or fifth. Not a shop reopening.
 *   4 trial started       Partner API     that shop began a free period
 *   5 trial converted     Partner API     the free period ended in a payment
 *
 * The seam between step 2 and step 3 is the whole difficulty of this report, and
 * it is not closed here. GA4 counts browsers; the Partner API counts shops. A
 * merchant who reads the listing on a laptop and installs from their desktop is
 * two visitors and one install, and one whose browser blocks analytics is no
 * visitor and one install. So the 2→3 rate is directional — it says whether
 * things are getting better or worse, not what fraction of clickers installed —
 * and steps 3-5 are read from the Partner API precisely because they are
 * complete there and would not be here.
 *
 * The spec's marketing cap does not apply. That rule exists for funnels that
 * *begin* with marketing-site traffic, where an uncapped downstream reports more
 * subscribers than visitors; this one begins at the listing page, and capping
 * installs to fit GA4's coverage would delete real installs to make a chart
 * monotonic. Where the counts do not descend, the report says so instead.

 * is right for active installs and for logo churn, where the question is whether

 * clicked Install, and there is no step 1 or 2 for that shop to have come from,

 * uninstalled in March and chose the app again in August is an acquisition in
 * August, and arrives as RELATIONSHIP_INSTALLED like any first-timer.
 *
 * Each step is counted in shops rather than in charges, so a merchant who
 * restarts a subscription inside one bucket is one shop at every step and the
 * funnel keeps descending. Plan changes are excluded from the trial steps for the reason
 * spelled out in the lifecycle compiler: a merchant moving tier carries a
 * nominal trial window they never actually sat through, and counting it turns
 * an afternoon of tier-shopping into a fresh trial cohort.
 *
 * Step 5 is bucketed by when the trial *started*, not by when the money landed,
 * so a column reads "of the trials that began here, this many converted" — the
 * same cohort rule the trials report uses. It is also why the newest buckets are
