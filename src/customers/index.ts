/**
 * The customer read model.

 * Deliberately computed at read time rather than kept as a rollup table. The
 * store is one merchant per row over a few tens of thousands of rows, and
 * SQLite answers these in single-digit milliseconds — so paying for a snapshot
 * table would buy nothing and cost the thing this project is built on: a figure
 * that can silently disagree with the reports beside it.
 *
 * Liveness comes from `asOfPredicate`, the same predicate every MRR and churn
 * chart uses. A customer's MRR on their own page is therefore the same number
 * that customer contributes to the MRR series, by construction rather than by
 * coincidence.

/**
 * Where an event sits on the timeline, which is not always when it is stamped.
 *
 * A review carries the day the App Store published it and no time — the listing
 * never shows one — so it is stored at that day's midnight. On a timeline that
 * reads as 00:00, which puts it ahead of every event that day whose time *is*
 * known: a merchant who installed at 09:15 and reviewed that afternoon appears
 * to have reviewed an app they had not installed yet.
 *
 * Sorting it to the end of its own day is the one placement that cannot be
 * wrong in that way. A review can only follow the install that made it
 * possible, so within a day the position is a deduction rather than a guess.
 * Where it truly sits among that day's other events is unknowable, and nothing
 * here pretends otherwise: `occurred_at` still holds midnight, the UI still
 * shows a date without a time, and only the ordering is decided here.
 *
 * String arithmetic rather than SQLite's `datetime()`, which would return
 * `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` and stop comparing lexically against the ISO instants
 * every other row holds.
