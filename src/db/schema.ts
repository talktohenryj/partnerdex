/**
 * The SQLite schema, applied idempotently on every open.
 *
 * Four roles, one file (the Partner API's volume comfortably fits SQLite):
 *   1. raw feeds        — `app_events`, `transactions` as returned by the API
 *   2. derived indexes  — `subscriptions`, `install_intervals`, normalized at
 *                         write time so read-time math is sums + date compares
 *   3. operational      — `sync_state`, `metric_cache`, `drift_snapshots`
 *   4. durable          — `notification_*`, `app_listings`, `app_reviews`, and
 *                         (via the migration runner in migrate.ts) `contacts`,
 *                         `contact_shops`, `contact_suppressions`
 *
 * Roles 1 and 2 are disposable: both are rebuilt from the API on demand. Role 4
 * is the only place in this store holding state that cannot be recovered by
 * re-syncing, which is why its tables are written to rather than rebuilt.
 *
 * Contacts deliberately do NOT live in this string. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
 * is a silent no-op once the table exists, so durable schema evolution needs a
 * real version path — see `src/db/migrate.ts`. Everything below still uses
 * IF NOT EXISTS because the disposable tables (and the Role-4 tables that
 * predate the runner) are safe under that model.
 *
 * Every timestamp column holds a canonical UTC ISO-8601 string, so lexical
 * comparison is chronological comparison and the as-of predicate is plain SQL.
