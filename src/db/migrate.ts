 * Schema changes `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot make on its own.
 *
 * SCHEMA_SQL is idempotent for a *new* database and silent for an existing one:
 * a table that is already there is left exactly as it was, including columns
 * that have since moved or been dropped. Closing that gap needs a record of
 * what a database has already seen, and SQLite ships one — `PRAGMA
 * user_version`, an integer in the file header that costs nothing to read.
 *
 * Minimal on purpose: read the pragma, run each pending up() inside a
 * transaction, bump the version. No down-migrations, no framework, no ledger
 * table.
 *
 * Every migration body below is also individually idempotent — each one checks
 * the database before it writes. That is deliberate belt and braces, not
 * redundancy. Migrations 1 and 2 were previously applied by an unversioned
 * function that ran on every open, so databases exist that hold the changes
 * while user_version is still 0; replaying them has to be a no-op rather than a
 * `duplicate column name` crash. Later migrations are free to drop the checks
 * where the change genuinely cannot be detected after the fact.
