/**
 * The BigQuery settings API.
 *
 * One rule shapes all of it: the service-account key goes in and never comes
 * out. `describe` is the only thing that ever renders a stored connection, and
 * it returns the account's email and the last of its key id — enough to answer
 * "which key is this?" and useless to anyone who intercepts it.
 *
 * The routes come in two levels, matching the data. `/` is the account — one
 * project, one key. `/apps/:appId` is where a GA4 export actually lives, which
 * is per app because a partner who put a separate measurement id on each
 * listing has a dataset per listing.
 *
 * Both levels have a check, and they answer different questions. The account
 * check proves the credential and lists the datasets it can see; the app check
 * proves one of those datasets really is a GA4 export and how far back it goes.
 * Both read INFORMATION_SCHEMA, so neither scans a byte of event data.
